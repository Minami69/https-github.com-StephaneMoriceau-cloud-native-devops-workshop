## DevOps and Cloud Native Microservices Workshop

This Oracle Public Cloud DevOps Cloud Native Microservices workshop will walk you through the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) for a Cloud Native project, during which you will create and use several Microservices. During this workshop you will take on the role of 3 personae. As the first persona - the Project Manager - you will create the projects, add tasks and features to be worked on, and assign tasks to developers.  The Project Manager will then start the initial sprint. The Java Developer persona will develop a new twitter feed service that will allow for retrieval and filtering of twitter data.
